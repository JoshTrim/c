# c
Rewriting classic CLI utils to improve my C programming. Inspired by [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

# rules
- no AI, we are doing this the old fashioned way
- no copy paste

# aims
- initial sketch of commonly used utils
- once initial idea is in place, go through man page and implement all subcommands + flags

# utils
- [-] cat
    - flags
        - [-] n
    - redo
        - [ ] use getline function instead of a predefined buffer size
- [-] grep
